### Join us

OpenHack is a free event, but space is limited.
We're a friendly bunch and enjoy meeting new people.

We meet on the **first Monday of the month** at **[Skills Matter][sm-group]** from **6:30-9:00 pm**.

### Requirements

You'll need a **laptop** and a **project** to work on.

This event may not be suitable for new or beginner programmers.
We recommend some familiarity with coding (at least a few months experience).

### What to expect

- Dedicated space for social casual coding in Central London

- Hack on whatever you want, with whoever you want

- Pair programming is welcome and encouraged

- Socializing and fun in a safe environment

### What not to expect

- This is **not** a hackathon or intense coding sprint

- This is **not** a class or course where you can learn to program  
  (There are many other meetups in London that already do this)

- This is **not** a place to find someone who will implement your ideas
  (for free or paid)

- You may not get a lot done, and that's okay.
  This is **not** the best place to be super productive.

- We do **not** tolerate harassment; all members are required to abide by our
  [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)

### Food & drink

Complimentary tea, coffee, and biscuits are provided by Skills Matter.

### Code of Conduct

We expect all of our attendees, sponsors, and volunteers to be respectful and
considerate of others. They are all required to agree with this code of conduct.
Organisers will enforce it throughout the event.

OpenHackLDN is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,

aforementioned). _We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form._
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate under any circumstances.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned, expelled, or permanently
excluded from the event at the discretion of the organisers or host.
