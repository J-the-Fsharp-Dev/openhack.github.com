### Info

You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
Skill level doesn’t matter. We don’t care if you’re working on Hello World or on increasing your wizarding level.
You don’t have to have an idea to hack on! You’re more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.

Meetings are held every 3rd thursday of the month from 6pm to 11pm.

Location and drinks gracefully provided by [10to1](http://10to1.be){:target="_blank"}, foodwise we're mostly ordering [pizzas from here](http://www.just-eat.be/restaurants-pizza-apetito-antwerpen/menu){:target="_blank"} or you can bring your own.
For ordering use the [slack food channel](https://openhack-antwerp.slack.com/messages/food/){:target="_blank"} or mention [@RidingWolf](https://twitter.com/ridingwolf){:target="_blank"}
